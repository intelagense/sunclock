starry background codepen

Need to add: right now everything 

Brainstorms:

could switch to a horizontal autoscrolling 2d map

would like the background to resemble the day night cycle in minecraft with stars that fade appear through the night sky. right now the background gradient is 3 colors could make the last color transparent and have a black starry background image behind it.

Lofty goals:

could add a conical gradient with dynamic edges to match the daylight to the perspective of the map at different times
